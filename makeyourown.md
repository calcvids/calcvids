## Instructions for making your own versions of the videos

Contact us for instructor versions of the video which include scripts. We have found the following steps to be useful in making videos:

1. You will need software for recording audio and for manipulating video on your computer. For recording audio, we have used [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and for video manipulation, we have used [lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/). You **may** be able to do this using only lightworks.
2. [Contact us](/team) for the instructor versions of the videos. These include the scripts which makes recording the videos much easier.
3. Play the instructor version of the video through headphones (e.g. on your phone) while you record yourself reading the script on your computer. By using two devices, it is much easier to ensure that you press record on your computer and play on a phone at the same time, so you will not need to worry about syncing up the audio and video in the next step.
4. Export your audio as a wav file.
5. Open lightworks, and import the student version of the video as well as your audio.
6. Replace the original audio in the video with your audio recording, and export. Lughtworks has a youtube setting if that's where you're planning on uploading it.
