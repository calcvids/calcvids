## Instructions for making your own versions of the videos

You can use our [Powerpoint slides](/slides) to edit or make your own version of the videos. This works best on a Windows computer.

To record audio and/or slide timings:
0. Make sure your microphone is connected to your computer and working correctly.
1. Download the Powerpoint slides for the video you want to modify or record
2. If you want to record narration for all of the slides and change the slide timings (i.e., how long each slide gets displayed), then you can click on the "Slide Show" tab, and then "Record Slide Show." 
3. If you want to record narration and change the slide timing for a single slide, advance to the slide you want to record, and click "Record Slide Show." When you are done, hit the "Escape" key (instead of advancing to the next slide).
4. If you want to record the audio for a single slide and/or avoid changing the slide timing, you will need to record a new audio file for each slide. Navigate to the slide for which you want to record audio. Go to the "Insert" tab and the "Audio" button, then "Record Audio..." After you have recorded the audio, go to the "Playback" tab and set the "Start:" option to "automatically." 

To export the slides as a video:
On a Windows computer, go to Home -> Export and export the presentation as a video file.
On a Macintosh computer, you'll need to play the presentation (in the Slide Show tab, click "Play from Start") and use screen recording software to record the presentation as it plays back. QuickTime has screen recording capability (go to File -> New Screen Recording) 


<!--Contact us for instructor versions of the video which include scripts. We have found the following steps to be useful in making videos:

1. You will need software for recording audio and for manipulating video on your computer. For recording audio, we have used [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and for video manipulation, we have used [lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/). You _may_ be able to do this using only lightworks.
2. [Contact us](/team) for the instructor versions of the videos. These include the scripts which makes recording the videos much easier.
3. Play the instructor version of the video through headphones (e.g. on your phone) while you record yourself reading the script on your computer. By using two devices, it is much easier to ensure that you press record on your computer and play on a phone at the same time, so you will not need to worry about syncing up the audio and video in the next step.
4. Export your audio as a wav file.
5. Open lightworks, and import the student version of the video as well as your audio.
6. Replace the original audio in the video with your audio recording, and export. Lughtworks has a youtube setting if that's where you're planning on uploading it.-->
