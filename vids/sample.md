For each calculus topic, we create 1-4 short videos to explain the topic and provide examples. Then, we create questions for students to answer before and after watching the videos, and (depending on the details of the experimental design) also include various resources for the students to use prior to watching the videos.

Each collection of videos, questions, and interventions is hosted on the Ximera platform, which records students' responses as well as how they interact with each video--the timestamps when they pause, play, skip, and complete watching each video.

We take all of these data and analyze them using quantitative and qualitative techniques to paint a picture of how students use and interact with the videos, what they learn from watching the videos, and how their usage is related to their learning.
