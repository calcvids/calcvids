Are you interested in using high-quality instructional videos in an introductory calculus class?

We are recruiting college-level instructors of first-semester calculus classes to use our videos during the fall, 2019, and spring, 2020 semesters.

Participants would have access to all of our video, assessment, and data-collection materials, support from the research team, and would receive financial compensation for participation.

Participants would be required to:
  - Participate in a 90-minute webinar to learn about the materials and how they have been designed
  - Have their students complete a short (5-minute) tutorial to learn how to use the Ximera platform
  - Require their students to watch one or more sets of videos using the Ximera platform. In addition to watching the videos, the students would complete pre- and post-video questions to assess their understanding of the concepts
  - Have their students complete a short (5-minute) demographic survey near the end of the semester
  
Benefits to participants:
  - Participants will receive $50 for completing the webinar
  - Participants will receive $15 for each video set that is assigned to their students
  - Participants will have access to high-quality instructional videos and will learn about the ideas that have been used to design the videos
  - Participants will receive support for the videos from the research team
  - Participants will have the option to receive data about their students' participation in the video-watching process (i.e., which videos the students watched and their students' responses to the pre- and post-video questions)
