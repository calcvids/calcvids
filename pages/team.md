His research focuses on the ways students learn from mathematical “texts” including textbooks, lectures, and instructional videos. His prior work on adapting ideas from literary criticism and organizational studies to learning mathematics shaped the design of the Calculus Videos Project.</p>

<p><img style="margin: 7px; float: right;" alt="Michael Tallman" width="140" src="/images/Tallman_Headshot.jpg" /><a href="http://www.michaeltallman.net/Personal/About.html"><strong>Michael Tallman</strong></a>&nbsp; received his B.Sc. and M.A. in mathematics from the University of Northern
Colorado and he received his Ph.D. in mathematics education from Arizona State University. Dr. Tallman has taught mathematics at the secondary and post-secondary levels. His primary research is in the area of mathematical knowledge for teaching secondary and post-secondary mathematics. Dr. Tallman's work informs the design of teacher preparation programs and professional development initiatives through an investigation of the factors that affect the nature and quality of the mathematical knowledge teachers leverage in the context of teaching. In particular, his research examines how various factors like curricula, emotional regulation, identity, and teachers' construction and appraisal of instructional constraints mediate the enactment of their subject matter knowledge.</p>
