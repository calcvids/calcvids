The Calcvids videos are based on research about student thinking and learning about calculus concepts. They leverage the idea of quantitative reasoning (described below) and present concepts from a quantitative, rather than a geometric focus (described below).

The videos are designed to be compatible with all calculus curricula. Although you can incorporate any subset of the videos into your class, there is a core set (described below) that develop the central quantitative ideas that we recommend you use.

There are numerous resources available for instructors on this website.


Information about the Concepts and Videos
---------
- A [flowchart](Calcvids_Flowchart.pdf) that shows the core videos and the relationships between the concepts in the videos
- A description of the key concepts, terminology, and notation used in the videos.
- A discussion of [the difference between quantitative and geometric reasoning]() and why Calcvids focuses on quantitative reasoning
- A [description of quantitative reasoning]()
- Additional information about quantitative reasoning:
  - A [description of quantitative reasoning](Quantitative_and_Covariational_Reasoning.pdf) by Michael Tallman
  - A [paper by Pat Thompson](http://bit.ly/18OpUu0) that describes all of the technical details of quantitative reasoning
  - A [paper by Moore, Carlson, and Oehrtman](http://sigmaa.maa.org/rume/crume2009/Moore1_LONG.pdf) that provides an example of using quantitative reasoning to describe students' thinking about precalculus problems
- A [description of intellectual need-provoking tasks](https://youtu.be/aJX7mC3H7lU) that we have created to support instruction

Instructional Resources
---------
- [Suggestions for Incorporating Videos into Instruction](Suggestions_for_Incorporating_Videos_into_Instruction.pdf)
- [Versions of the materials](/lms) that can be directly imported into various learning management systems (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, etc.)
- [Powerpoint Files](/slides) you can use to create your own versions of the videos
- [Additional homework problems](/problems) you can assign to your students
- [Intellectual Need-Provoking Tasks](/intasks) you can use for in-class problem-solving and discussion
