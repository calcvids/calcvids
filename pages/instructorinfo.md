# What you'll need to do:
  - Participate in an online professional development workshop
  - Provide a description of their use of the videos in their classes (we will send a survey at the end of the semester)
  - Describe the study to your students at the beginning of the semester
  - Assign one or more Ximera sets for your students to complete as part of their regular class activities
  - Assign the [Ximera Introduction](https://ximera.osu.edu/calcvidstest/intro/intro) (on Ximera) to your students
  - Assign the [end-of-semester survey](https://ximera.osu.edu/calcvidstest/survey/survey/survey) (on Ximera) to your students

# How to assign videos using Ximera:
  - All Ximera sets should be assigned by having students visit [https://calcvids.org/vids/](https://calcvids.org/vids/) and clicking on the title of the assigned video set

# Human subjects information
  - Instructors will need to complete a [consent form](Instructor_Informed_Consent-Fillable.pdf)
  - Students will give consent (or not) to participate as part of the "Ximera Introduction". Please emphasize to your students that they will be watching the videos and completing the tasks as part of their regular class activities; giving consent lets the researchers use their data to help students learn calculus
  - Students who are younger than 18 years old will need to get parental consent to participate.
