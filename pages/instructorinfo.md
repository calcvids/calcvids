What you'll need to do
-----------------------
- Participate in an online professional development workshop
- Provide a description of your use of the videos in their classes (we will send a survey at the end of the semester)
- Describe the study to your students at the beginning of the semester
- Assign one or more Ximera sets for your students to complete as part of their regular class activities
- Assign the [Ximera Introduction](https://ximera.osu.edu/calcvids2019/intro/intro) (on Ximera) to your students
- Assign the [end-of-semester survey](https://ximera.osu.edu/calcvids2019/survey/survey) (on Ximera) to your students


How to assign videos using Ximera
----------------------------------
All Ximera sets should be assigned by having students visit [https://calcvids.org/vids/](https://calcvids.org/vids/) (**_NOT_** calcvids.org/videos/) and clicking on the title of the assigned video set


Using Ximera
------------
   There are two methods for logging in to Ximera: one where students use usernames and passwords that are supplied by the Calcvids team, and one where students use their institutional Google-enabled login.

- **Using a Google-enabled login**
  - If your institution has a Google-enabled account, you can elect for your students to log in to Ximera with their institutional username and password.
  - Students will click on "Sign In" in the top right corner of Ximera and then click "Sign In With Google" and then enter their institutional username and password as shown in [this screenshot](Logging_in_to_Ximera_Google.png).
  - If you provide a link to an assignment on calcvids.org/vids via your LMS (e.g., Canvas), the students may be automatically logged in to Ximera.
  - The first time students log in on a new device or browser, they need to go to Video Set 1 where they can enter their name and select their instructor. They can then watch any video set, and results will be added to your spreadsheets.
  - In order to use this option, we need to include your name on the instructor list by January 1st, 2020.

- **Using our usernames and passwords**
  - If your institution doesn't use Google-enabled logins -- or if you haven't told us you'd like to use Google logins by January 1st -- your students will need to log in to Ximera with a username and password we provide.
  - Send us your class roster, and we will send you back a username and password for each student.
  - Students will enter their username and password as shown in [this screenshot](Logging_in_to_Ximera.png).

- **Common Information**
  - The research team will create a folder on Google Drive for each instructor. This folder will contain a spreadsheet for each Ximera set students complete showing the date/time each student watched the videos and their score on the post-video questions. This folder will be updated daily at 6 AM Eastern US time. To access the folder, instructors should send their Google (or Google-connected) email address to Matt Thomas (<mthomas7@ithaca.edu>).
  - When logging in the first time, students may be forwarded to ximera.osu.edu. They can click the back button in their browser to return to the video set they were viewing.
  - After completing the work on a page -- including watching a video -- either click the blue "Save" at the top of the screen or wait for the button to switch to "Saved!"

- **Certificates**:
  - Regardless of which method you use, your students can download a certificate with their progress through the set on the last page of each set. If you would like, you can have students upload these certificates to verify completion of the assignment.
  - Here are instructions for downloading a Ximera certificate in [MS Word format](Ximera_Certificate_Instructions.docx) and in [PDF format](Ximera_Certificate_Instructions.pdf).


Reading Ximera spreadsheet files
--------------------
If you have sent us your Google-connected email address, you have access to a Google Drive folder with a collection of spreadsheets--one for each Ximera set that at least one of your students has completed. Each spreadsheet has 15 columns:
 - The first three columns show the student's first name, last name, and username
- "Date Started" is the date when the student started watching the videos
- "Time Started" is the time (in Zulu time zone) when the student started watching the videos
 - "Video 0 Watched" shows the percent of Video 0 that the student watched. Only about 1/3 of students in a class see the Video 0, so all of the other students will have a "NA" in this column
 - The next three columns show the percent of each video that the student has watched. There are some Ximera sets that only have 1 or 2 videos; when Video 2 or 3 doesn't exist for a particular set, there will be a "NA" in the column
- The next column is an average of the percent complete of the video which were watched. This averages the video percentages among the videos which are available to the student. If they had a video 0 available to them, this will be averaged. If not, it will only average the videos available.
- "Number Post Video Questions Correct" is the number of post-video questions answered correctly
- "Percent Post Video Questions Correct" is the percentage of post-video questions answered correctly
- "What was confusing" is the student's response to the first question on the reflection page about what they found confusing in the video.
- "Clip 1 Response" is the students' response to what was occurring in video clip 1
- "Clip 2 Response" is the students' response to what was occurring in video clip 2
- The next 11 columns are the number of tries it took for the student to get the correct answer on that the respective post-video question


Human subjects information
--------------------------
- Instructors will need to complete a [consent form](Instructor_Informed_Consent-Fillable.pdf).
- Students will give consent (or not) to participate as part of the "Ximera Introduction." Please emphasize to your students that they will be watching the videos and completing the tasks as part of their regular class activities; giving consent lets the researchers use their data to help students learn calculus.
- Students who are younger than 18 years old will need to get parental consent to participate. We will provide a consent form soon.
