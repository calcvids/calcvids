# Use the widgets beneath and the content will be
# inserted automagically in the webpage. To make
# this work, you have to use â€º layout: frontpage
#
layout: page-fullwidth

#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

# This is a nasty hack to make the navigation highlight
# this page as active in the topbar navigation
