<p>The Calculus Video Project is an NSF-funded project <em>Investigating Student Learning and Sense-Making from Instructional Calculus Videos</em> (awards DUE <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1712312&HistoricalAwards=false">#1712312</a>, DUE <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1711837&HistoricalAwards=false">#1711837</a> and DUE <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1710377&HistoricalAwards=false">#1710377</a>).</p>

<p>The growing interest in progressive instructional formats such as “flipped” and “blended” classrooms has made video lessons an increasingly prominent component of post-secondary mathematics curricula. However, relatively little is known about how students watch and learn from instructional videos.</p>

<p>We have created instructional videos and supporting resources--including pre- and post-video questions, in-class tasks, Powerpoint slides, and files that can be imported into learning management systems (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, etc.). All of these materials are free for instructors to use.</p>
