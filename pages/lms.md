We are working on creating modules that instructors can integrate into their LMS (learning management system). Each module include a set of pre-video questions, an intellectual need-provoking task and video, instructional videos, and post-video questions.
These modules can be customized after importing into your LMS.

These materials Coming Soon!!!
